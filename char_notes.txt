/* character shit */

/* Identity */
- Not sure who he is, where he is from, and finds he is not a naturally occuring
  being.
- black mage
- Dies or unknown at the end
- Spends most his story finding people who relate to him and how to not be
  judged, have confidence, and do some hardcore doom death black magic shit.
- Does he even have a soul?

/* Vivi's fear of Mortality */
AI Vivi's Fear of Mortality: Vivi's awareness of his limited lifespan and the
impending mortality of his fellow black mages instills in him a profound fear of
death. This fear serves as a catalyst for his introspection and prompts him to
contemplate the meaning of life, the inevitability of death, and the transient
nature of existence.
